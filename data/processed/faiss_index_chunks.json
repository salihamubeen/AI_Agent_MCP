The institute started its operation in 1921 as the Mughalpura Technical College, deriving its name from the famous suburb of the old city of Lahore, richly dotted with architectural heritage of the great Mughals including the magnificent Shalimar Gardens. Its more familiar name of the pre-University era, the Maclagan Engineering College, was given to it in 1923 when Sir Edwards Maclagan, the then Governor of the Punjab, laid the foundation stone of the building, now called the Main Block, which still retains its majesty in spite of the wear and tear of almost a century. At that time, the institution offered courses of study in two disciplines, namely Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. The year 1932 is a major milestone in the evolution of this institution when it was affiliated with the University of the Punjab for award of a Bachelor's degree in Engineering. At the time of Independence, i.e., in 1947, it had well-established B.Sc. degree courses in civil, electrical and mechanical engineering, and the quality of its scholastic standards won it a place of prestige throughout the British India. In 1954, it started a Bachelor's degree course in Mining Engineering, the first-ever of its kind in the country. But its massive expansion and development commenced in 1961 on its transformation into a University. It set for itself a variety of goals, but the first priority was to start teaching of those disciplines, which were crucial for national development but were not catered for by any institution in the country. Accordingly, in the sixties, Bachelor's degree courses were started in Chemical Engineering, Petroleum &",

Later, the University concentrated its energies and resources on developing its postgraduate programs. By 1970's it had established over a score of Master's degree courses in diverse specializations of engineering, architecture, planning and allied disciplines. Ph.D. degree program was also instituted in a number of disciplines. The process of consolidating and strengthening continued to be a major concern of the University, with phenomenal increase in student's enrollment in seventies. Consequently, the University College of Engineering was established in 1975 at Sahiwal. For three years it functioned at Sahiwal and was shifted to its present campus at Taxila in 1978. Subsequently, this college was upgraded to a university and it is currently functioning as University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila. Establishing traditions of research in the engineering and allied disciplines has been a major goal of the University. With this end in view, the University established a Directorate of Research, Extension and Advisory Services, now called Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC), which strives for the promotion and organization of research activities. In the recent past, there has been a substantial rise in students' enrollment and the figure has now gone up to over 13,163. Currently, 2,527 students are pursuing postgraduate studies. The number of female students enrolling for different disciplines is ever on the increase and is 3,462 at present. The number of foreign students coming from countries, like Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Kenya, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Bangladesh, Yemen, Somalia, Nigeria, Ethopia and Sri Lanka is over 479 which gives the University Campus a cosmopolitan character. The university has 766 teachers of which 382 have a Ph.D. degree, whereas 101 are pursuing Ph.D. abroad.

Rachna College of Engineering & Technology, Gujranwala is a constituent college and follows the same academic curriculum and policies as the ones followed at the main campus in Lahore. In 2012, the university established a new campus in Narowal with an aim to produce quality technical manpower for the District of Narowal and its surroundings. In addition to managing its own campus, the University controls the academic programs and examinations of numerous institutions, which are affiliated with it for award of degrees.",
